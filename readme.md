# Engine

The engine which runs algorithms and computes frames.

More detailed documentation of the engine can be found
[here](https://syga.kam.mff.cuni.cz/docs).

At the moment, the engine is also used as a REST API for the webapp. This will
change in later versions - REST API will be a separate service which is
responsible for creating and running engine containers.
