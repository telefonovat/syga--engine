    A frame stores all data used to draw one step of the visualized algorithm.
    A frame is created from tick by computing the style of the components. After
    that, neighbouring frames, which are equal, are merged into one.
    Frame consists of:
      - lineno: taken from the tick which became a frame
      - console_logs: The current stdout output forwarded here, possible merged
      - components: The style of the components - see Visualizer.compute_style

        Defines the conversion to bool for a frame.

        The conditions for deciding the thruthyness of a Frame are:
          1. if there are console logs, the frame is truthy - never remove frames
             with console logs
          2. if there are no components (ie. self.components is empty) and there
             are no console logs, the frame is falsy - such frames are useless
          3. If there are components, but no console logs, the frame is truthy only
             if at least one of it's components has truthy style - this means that
             component['style'] is not None and is not an empty dict

          The third rule might be removed later on, because it prevents people from
          using no style, but observing the changes in a structure of a visualizer.
          For example changes in nodes and edges of a graph will be ignored if at
          least one style property has not been specified for the graph.
